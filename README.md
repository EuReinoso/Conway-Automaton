The game of life is an idea of an automaton created by John Conway. It consists of the following rules:

- Any living cell with less than two living neighbors dies of loneliness.
- Any living cell with more than three living neighbors dies of overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three living neighbors becomes a living cell.
- Any living cell with two or three living neighbors remains in the same state for the next generation.
